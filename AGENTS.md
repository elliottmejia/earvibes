# AI Agents & Tools

This project is designed to be friendly for AI coding assistants and agents. The structure is modular, typed, and follows clear patterns that make it easy for LLMs to understand and modify.

## Recommended Tools

Users can employ various AI tools to extend or modify this application:

*   **Google Gemini**: Excellent for logic generation, refactoring, and explaining complex music theory concepts within the app's context.
*   **GitHub Copilot**: Great for inline code completion and boilerplate reduction.
*   **Cursor / Windsurf**: Ideal for full-project context-aware editing.

## Guidelines for AI Agents

If you are using an AI agent to modify this codebase, please adhere to the following patterns:

1.  **Context is Key**: Always read `types.ts` and `constants.ts` first. These files define the domain model (Levels, Chords, GameState).
2.  **Type Safety**: Ensure generated code adheres to the TypeScript definitions. Do not use `any`.
3.  **Localization**: 
    *   **Never hardcode UI text.** 
    *   Always add new strings to `i18n/locales/en.ts` first.
    *   If possible, add translations for `es.ts`, `pt.ts`, and `ja.ts`.
    *   Use the `useTranslation` hook to access strings.
4.  **Audio Engine**: 
    *   Modifications to `audioService.ts` must respect the Tone.js lifecycle.
    *   Audio context must only resume/start after a user interaction event (click/keydown).
5.  **State Management**: 
    *   The app uses a centralized `GameState` object in `App.tsx`.
    *   Avoid creating parallel state trees unless necessary for a specific isolated component.

## Prompt Engineering Tips

When asking an AI to generate new levels, use this structure:

> "Create a new Level 13 based on the 'Phrygian Mode'. 
> 1. Update `types.ts` LevelType enum.
> 2. Update `constants.ts` with the level configuration (available chords).
> 3. Update `services/theoryService.ts` with the chord maps and generation logic.
> 4. Update `i18n/locales/*.ts` with the level title, description, lesson content, and chord descriptions."
